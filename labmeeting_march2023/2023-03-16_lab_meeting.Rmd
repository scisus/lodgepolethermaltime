## Lodgepole pine flowering biology

In spring

- Male strobili shed pollen
- Female strobili capture pollen

Wind pollinated

## Phenology matters

- Gene flow
  - assortative mating
  - (local) adaptation
  - clinal variation
- Seed orchard management
- Tree breeding
- Assisted migration

<!-- Talk about jean paul's work on how there can be clinal variation just from phenology - fucking up your local adapation estimates -->

## What controls the timing of flowering phenology in lodgepole pine?

::::::::::::: {.columns}

<!-- We can't see most development phases and have to infer from events. Review Rob Guy. -->
- Chilling accumulation

## Data
- 748 clones of 259 genotypes
- grown in 7 seed orchards across BC
- flowering state recorded every few days over a one day to several week period
- 15 total years of data collection

Provenance

- seeds and scions from 143 natural stands
- grafted onto rootstock to create a clone bank
- clone bank scions selected based on superior growth, form

## Data
```{r data}
phenf <- readRDS("objects/phenf.rds")
ggplot(phenf, aes(x = sum_forcing, color = Event_Label, linetype = Sex)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  labs(title = "Cumulative distribution of accumulated forcing at observation", caption = "raw data") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d() +
  theme_dark(base_size = 18) +
  ylab("") +
  xlab("GDD")
```

## How much forcing?

- 4 models
  - Begin (male) pollen shed
  - End (male) pollen shed
  - Begin (female) receptivity
  - End (female) receptivity
- Thermal time - transferable
- Test for provenance climate effect - MAT
- Account for variance due to site, year, genotype, and clone
- Account for unbalanced and censored data

## Likelihood model

Likelihood of forcing observations would have a normal distribution

$$
f_i \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\phi_i, \sigma)
$$
But all of my data is censored.

```{r censoring}
censdf <- readRDS("objects/censdf.rds") %>%
  rename(Event = Event_Label) 
censdf$Event <- c("begin", "begin", 'end', 'end')
knitr::kable(censdf)
```

## Likelihood model - for censored data

So we assume an underlying normal distribution that we're observing badly.

- Left censored start data (hazard function) 
<!-- more likely to observe flowering after flowering has started -->
$$
\mathrm{Pr}[f_i < U] = \int_\infty^U \mathrm{Normal}(y \mid \phi_i, \sigma) dy
$$
- Right censored end data (survival function)
<!-- more likely to observe pollen shed is finished after it has finished -->
$$
\mathrm{Pr}[f_i > L] = \int_L^\infty \mathrm{Normal}(y \mid \phi_i, \sigma) dy
$$
- Interval censored data
$$
\mathrm{Pr}[L > f_i > U] = \int_L^U \mathrm{Normal}(y | \phi_i, \sigma) dy
$$

## Modeling the mean

$$
\phi_i = \alpha + \beta MAT + \delta_{Site, i} + \delta_{Year, i} + \delta_{Clone, i} + \delta_{Ramet, i}
$$

- $\alpha$: Overall mean forcing requirement
- $\beta$: Provenance climate effect using MAT as covariate
- $\delta$: Offsets from the overall mean based on site, year, clone, and ramet

## Priors

<!-- Limit parameter estimates to forcing accumulations possible at our sites during late spring, when lodgepole pine are known to flower in British Columbia and approximately known length of the flowering period from prior work -->
::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
- limits based on possible forcing accumulation
- gamma distribution for intercept
- half normal for offset parameter standard deviations

<!-- Forcing accumulation is always positive and the overall distribution across reasonable ranges is strongly right skewed, so we used a gamma distribution with shape ($\alpha$) and rate ($\beta$) parameters derived from the mean and standard deviation of the May-June historical forcing accumulation. -->

<!-- site and year have relatively few levels with which to estimate $\sigma_{factor}$, half normal priors with their relatively thin tails were used to help constrain offset parameter standard deviations -->

## Fit

Modelling events I didn't observe - so how can I check how my model is doing?

![](modelfit.pdf)
<!-- Are the mean begin, end, and length retrodictions within the expected ranges? The exact flowering period is never observed because of censoring. -->
<!-- # Using the first and last observed flowering forcing/doy we construct the max begin and minimum end forcing/doy and minimum flowering period length in forcing and days for the data. -->
<!-- # Using the last observed before flowering forcing/doy and the first observed after flowering forcing/doy, we construct a minimum begin day, maximum end day, and maximum flowering period length for the data. We expect model estimates to be between the min and max ranges for the observations. -->

  xlab("Male flowering") +
  ylab("Female flowering") 

```

## Summary
- Males have longer period and start slightly before, end after females
- ~5 more GDD per 1 degree MAT required for flowering
- Countergradient variation should increase flowering period overlap
- Overlap depends on geographic location and provenance climate
- Anybody can predict flowering time in lodgepole with just daily temperature data and MAT - with no modelling required.

### Questions
- But why is there countergradient variation?

### More
- Climate change (1 month shift, no big overlap changes)
- Does it all wash away in the light of individual variation?

## Extra

fpred <- readRDS('objects/fpred.rds')
ggplot(fpred, aes(x = MAT, y = sum_forcing)) +
